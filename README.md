# Sorting Algorithms

*Rolling development: new algorithms are still being pushed*

Hello, and welcome to my Sorting Algorithms repo! The purpose of this is to expand my knowledge of sorting algorithms, their advantages and disadvantages, and practice my coding.

**Structure**

Each sorting algorithm implemented has their own unique folder. In which holds 6 files and is implemented in 4 languages:

- Python3
- JavaScript
- C++
- Java
- Bash (runs all of the above programs in one go)

Additionally, each algorithm has a README with more information about the algorithm including its pros and cons and how to run it. Every file has comments explaining each step and how it relates to the whole problem.
